# Backups

Your cloud data is backed up continuously and retained for 30 days.
Within those 30 days we can restore your data to any point in time with a precision of 5 minutes, in case you need us to.

## Download

For the time being you cannot download backups yourself.
You will have to [get in touch](mailto:support@openproject.com) with us.
We can then provide a current or past backup (database + attachments) to you.

This way you can also get your data if you decide to stop using the Cloud Edition.
